## Overview

The roadmap covers:

- React fundamentals (JSX, components, props, state)
- effects, event handling, and component architecture
- React Router, Context API, and custom hooks
- API integration, styling (Tailwind CSS / Styled Components), performance optimization, and deployment

## Status
