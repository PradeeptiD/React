# React Roadmap

Over the next month, I'll be following a structured React learning path designed to help me move from beginner to intermediate level in React development.

## Overview

The roadmap covers:

- React fundamentals (JSX, components, props, state)
- effects, event handling, and component architecture
- React Router, Context API, and custom hooks
- API integration, styling (Tailwind CSS / Styled Components), performance optimization, and deployment

## Status

- Completed mini blog layout using JSX, components and props
- Completed login page using useInput custom hook and onChange logic
- Completed making comments section by rendering components conditionally based on state or props and rendering lists with unique keys

🟡 Currently working on creating a useInterval hook that accepts a callback and delay

```
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react

cd my-react-app

npm run dev
```
